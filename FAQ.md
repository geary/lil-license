Why publish yet another license? Why not just use [MIT](http://mitlicense.org)?

The MIT License is lovely: functional, relatively clear in intent to all readers
— not just lawyers — and has stood the test of time.
[Roughly half](https://github.com/blog/1964-open-source-license-usage-on-github-com)
of all open source projects use it. But it was written in the 1980s, and as open
source authors and users we've learned that, in practice, we need just a little
bit more: a declaration of the intent not to use software patents against users,
and the shared understanding that contributions back to the project will be
incorporated under the same terms of the license.


What else is different about the Lil License?

Some of the legal phrasing has been simplified, the [legally UNNECESSARY SHOUTY
TEXT](https://www.cameronhuff.com/blog/why-not-use-CAPITAL-LETTERS/index.html)
quieted, and the words generally boiled down to a bare minimum. You may
include the license verbatim or link to it instead, and there's also a bit about
having no obligations to provide support or updates to your code.


This license won't work for my project because of [ ... ]. Can I fix it?

You certainly can. Although we've put significant care and thought into the
precise formulation of this license, there's no reason why it shouldn't be made
even better. In fact, the "Lil" stands for "Lil Improvable License". Go ahead
and make your changes. If you think they'd benefit everyone, please submit them
[on Github](https://github.com/jashkenas/lil-license). The goal here is to
whittle this thing down to a minimal social and legal contract among authors,
contributors and users of open source. In plain English.


This license is a terrible idea. We need something more legally robust!

If you're looking for a tried and tested, every term defined, dot the i's and
cross the t's, permissive open source license, try [the Apache
License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). It will serve you well.


This license is a terrible idea. Software authors need to be able to be paid for
their work!

Check out [License Zero](https://licensezero.com/). It helps software stay free
for use and modification for non-commercial purposes, while commercial users
can be required to pay after a trial period.


I decided to license my project under the LIL. Does anyone care?

We do. Please take a moment to
[add it to the wiki](https://github.com/jashkenas/lil-license/wiki/List-of-LIL-Licensed-Projects).
