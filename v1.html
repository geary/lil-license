<div class="faq"><h2>FAQ</h2>
<p>Why publish yet another license? Why not just use <a href="http://mitlicense.org">MIT</a>?</p>
<p>The MIT License is lovely: functional, relatively clear in intent to all readers
— not just lawyers — and has stood the test of time.
<a href="https://github.com/blog/1964-open-source-license-usage-on-github-com">Roughly half</a>
of all open source projects use it. But it was written in the 1980s, and as open
source authors and users, we've learned that in practice, we need just little
bit more: a declaration of the intent not to use software patents against users,
and the shared understanding that contributions back to the project will be
incorporated under the same terms of the license.</p>
<p>What else is different about the Lil License?</p>
<p>Some of the legal phrasing has been simplified, the legally UNNECESSARY SHOUTY
TEXT quieted, and the words generally boiled down to a bare minimum. You can
include the license verbatim or link to it instead, and there's also a bit about
having no obligations to provide support or updates to your code.</p>
<p>This license won't work for me because of [ ... ] Can I fix it?</p>
<p>You sure can! The &quot;LIL&quot; actually stands for &quot;Lil Improvable License&quot;. Go ahead
and make your changes. If you think they'd benefit everyone, please submit them
<a href="https://github.com/jashkenas/lil-license">on Github</a>. The goal here is to
whittle this thing down to a minimal social and legal contract between authors
and users of open source. In plain English.</p>
<p>This license is a terrible idea. We need something more legally robust!</p>
<p>If you're looking for a tried and tested, fully-baked, dot the i's and cross
the tee's, permissive open source license, try
<a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">the Apache License</a>. It will serve
you well.</p>
<p>This license is a terrible idea. Open source authors need to be paid for their
work!</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://licensezero.com/">License Zero</a>. It helps open source
software stay free to use and modify for non-commercial purposes, while
commercial users can be required to pay after a trial period.</p>
<p>I just decided to license my project under LIL. Does anyone care?</p>
<p>We do. Please take a moment to <a href="http://example.com">add it to the wiki</a>.</p>
